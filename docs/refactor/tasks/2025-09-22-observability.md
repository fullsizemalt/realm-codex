# Phase 3 Observability and Self-Healing

**Service/Subsystem:** observability
**Date:** 2025-09-22

## DoD (Phase 3 - Observability & Self-Healing)
- [x] Centralized logging with Loki (deployed and configured)
- [x] Metrics collection with Prometheus (scraping arcanum service)
- [x] Monitoring dashboards with Grafana (realm-observability dashboard)
- [x] Log aggregation from all services (Promtail collecting Docker logs)
- [x] Automated remediation scripts for common issues (self_healing.py)
- [x] Anomaly detection and alerting (Prometheus alert rules)
- [x] Self-healing mechanisms (restart, scale, rollback capabilities)

## Plan
1. Set up Prometheus for metrics collection
2. Configure Loki for centralized logging
3. Deploy Grafana with pre-built dashboards
4. Integrate arcanum service with observability stack
5. Create automated remediation scripts
6. Implement anomaly detection gates
7. Test self-healing scenarios

## Risk & Rollback
- **Risk**: Observability stack resource usage
- **Rollback**: Keep existing monitoring scripts as backup
- **Mitigation**: Start with lightweight configs, scale gradually
