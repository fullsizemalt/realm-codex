# Phase 4 AI Agents Standardization

**Service/Subsystem:** ai-agents
**Date:** 2025-09-22

## DoD (Phase 4 - AI Agents Standardization)
- [ ] Agent specification schema (capabilities, models, SLOs)
- [ ] Attribution logging for all AI interactions
- [ ] Canary deployment system for agent updates
- [ ] SLO monitoring per agent type (latency, accuracy, cost)
- [ ] Agent registry with version management
- [ ] Cross-agent compatibility framework
- [ ] Quality gates for agent deployments

## Plan
1. Design agent specification schema (YAML-based)
2. Enhance arcanum service with attribution logging
3. Create agent registry and version management
4. Implement canary deployment for agent configs
5. Add agent-specific SLO monitoring
6. Create agent quality gates and testing framework
7. Standardize Claude/Gemini/local agent interfaces

## Risk & Rollback
- **Risk**: Agent behavior changes affecting user experience
- **Rollback**: Version-controlled agent configs with instant rollback
- **Mitigation**: Canary deployments with automatic rollback on SLO violations
