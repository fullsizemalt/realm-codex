# Phase 6: De-risk & Decommission - COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Completion Date**: 2025-09-22

## Summary

Phase 6 successfully completed the final cleanup and decommissioning of legacy systems, reducing attack surface and establishing a clean, production-ready environment.

## 🎯 Achievements

### ✅ Legacy System Audit

- **Process Monitoring**: Identification of network services and potential security risks

### ✅ Automated Cleanup Framework
- **Quick Cleanup**: `scripts/quick_cleanup.py` - Fast removal of obvious waste
- **Legacy Scanner**: `scripts/legacy_scanner.py` - Deep scan for dead files and security risks
- **Quota Management**: Integration with existing storage management tools

### ✅ Directory Organization
- **Consolidated Structure**: `~/realm/{codex,refactor}` - Clean, logical organization
- **Eliminated Duplication**: Removed redundant directory structures
- **Clear Separation**: Original baseline vs. enhanced production system

### ✅ Documentation & GitHub Integration
- **GitHub Pages**: Live documentation at https://fullsizemalt.github.io/realm-codex/
- **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow for continuous documentation
- **Comprehensive Navigation**: All phases and runbooks properly organized

## 🔧 Phase 6 Tools

### Service Management
```bash
make service-audit               # Audit running services and containers
make docker-cleanup              # Clean all Docker resources
```

### File Cleanup
```bash
make quick-cleanup               # Remove temp files and old downloads
make legacy-scan                 # Deep scan for legacy files
make cleanup-dead                # Remove identified dead files
```

### Security & Storage
```bash
make security-report             # Security and privacy analysis
make find-duplicates             # Identify duplicate files
make quota-check                 # Storage quota monitoring
```

## 📊 System Health Assessment

### Current State (Post-Cleanup)
- **Running Services**: 5 (all production observability stack)
- **Stopped Containers**: 0 (cleaned up)
- **Docker Images**: Optimized (no dangling images)
- **File System**: Clean, organized structure
- **Security**: No immediate risks identified

### Production Services (Retained)
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Loki**: Centralized logging
- **Promtail**: Log collection
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and notifications

### Decommissioned Items
- **Stopped Containers**: 3 containers removed (573kB freed)
- **Legacy Files**: Automated cleanup of temp files and old downloads
- **Directory Duplication**: Consolidated 3 realm directories into 1

## 🎯 Security Posture

### Risk Reduction
- **Attack Surface**: Minimized through service decommissioning
- **File Security**: Automated scanning for sensitive files
- **Process Monitoring**: Regular audits of running services
- **Container Security**: Clean Docker environment

### Ongoing Monitoring
- **Automated Alerts**: Prometheus monitoring for all services
- **Health Checks**: Continuous service health validation
- **Resource Monitoring**: Quota and usage tracking
- **Security Scanning**: Regular provenance and security scans
